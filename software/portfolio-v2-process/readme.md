I built this website around the start of 2017. I showed my portfolio page to some friends, and I realized how ugly it was. So I hopped on my computer and got to work.

## Quick Stats
&nbsp;                  | &nbsp;
----------------------- | ----------
**TOOLS USED** | *NodeJS* and *Hexo* for generating HTML/Javascript, [*Stylus*](http://stylus-lang.com/) for CSS processing, *Bootstrap* and [*Masonry*](http://masonry.desandro.com/) for the dynamic grid layout.

## Game plan
I liked the idea of a static site generator (thanks to my work on the SnackWatcher project), and I've been looking for an excuse to use more JavaScript. So I looked around for an SSG running on NodeJS and found [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

## Pulling it off
I started by sketching some layouts on paper, and I ended up with a grid-based design I liked. I then started looking around for JS libraries I can use, and I stumbled on [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/layout.html). That made this project a whole lot easier.

For the visual design, I wanted something simple, so I stuck to a palette of black, white, and red. I used textures on element backgrounds as a quick way to add interest to simple colours. Box-shadows were another nice touch, bringing a subtle 3D element to page elements.

When you click the post images on this site, you'll see a fullscreen version thanks to [jQuery.LiteBox](https://github.com/ioquatix/jquery-litebox).
