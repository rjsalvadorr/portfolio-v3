One time, I was walkin' around the block during fall 2017, and I noticed one of my neighbours painting their garage door. I saw and admired the progress, and it was looking cooler and cooler as the days went by. <!-- more -->

One night, he was frantically painting with an accomplice. Seeing this, I couldn't stop myself from trying to help. It's been a while since I painted at this point, but I've done a bit of brushwork back in high school. These cool gentlemen accepted my offer, and so we spent the next few hours painting and shooting the shit. Turns out the chief artist had to move the next day so it HAD to be finished as soon as possible. Thankfully, he's fleshed out most of the thing, so all we had to do was fill in some spaces to bring everything together.
